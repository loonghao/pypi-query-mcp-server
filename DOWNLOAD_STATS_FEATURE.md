## 🧪 Testing

- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests with 76% coverage
- ✅ Mock-based testing for reliable CI/CD
- ✅ Integration tests for all new MCP tools
- ✅ Demo script with real-world examples

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

- ✅ All existing functionality remains unchanged
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing APIs
- ✅ New features are additive only

## 🌟 Ready for Use

This feature is production-ready and can be used immediately after merging. The pypistats.org API is stable and widely used by the Python community.

## 📝 Notes

- This implementation uses the pypistats.org API which provides download statistics for the last 180 days
- For longer historical data, users can be directed to use Google BigQuery with PyPI datasets
- The top packages functionality is based on known popular packages due to API limitations
